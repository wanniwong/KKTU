=== Patient's Queue Priority ===

2nd : Senior Citizen / Government Officer / OKU
3rd : Other

=== Room Type -> Service Type ===
6-9 : General
11  : Diabetes Observation

=== Queue Number ===
'5' as 1st digit : Walk-in patient (Start from 5000)
'6' as 1st digit : Patient registered from mobile application (Start from 6000)

Rule : Every new queue number is generated by incrementing the previous queue number by 1.
 
=== 'Call' Function ===
1. A patient can registered via kktu mobile application ONLY IF the admin is online since the admin will only log in the queue management system during the operating hours. ('Call' tab have to be opened)
2. Once the patient cancelled the queue, the system will pop out notification to alert the admin and that you can see that queue number is removed from the queue list.
3. In this function, the admin can call or recall the patient.  Once the patient is served, the admin can click the 'served' button and so the patient is removed from the queue list.


=== 'Pharmacy' Function ===
1. For the 'Medicine Collection' in the kktu mobile application, no 'Cancel' option for the patient since the patient only queue for medicine collection based on doctor's instruction.
2. This function is similiar to the 'Call' function.
